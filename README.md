# HareAndHounds
A human-to-human C++ rendition of the game Hare and Hounds with the help of GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit. 
My prompt is a python homework assignment from my first programming class at CMU.
Rules I implemented come from the Wikipedia page on the game:

The executable is in bin/Debug
